                This website is meant to be a tool that will aid you in your quest! Just as any quest needs a Master, the players need a way to keep track of all the necessary
                information. Traditionally this was done with paper and pencil, however due to the plague currently affecting humanity this is no longer possible. On this site exists all
                of the tools and information for you to manage your character and complete your quest. Good Luck!

                This website was made to combat some of the issues presenting budding adventurers. Since the scurge of Covid-19, the traditional style of adventuring has become harder.
                To help this website contains a compendeum of information that can be accessed via the side menu, each table lists the name of the spell/item/monster and then links to a page
                where all the details can be found.<br/>
                In the dice roller you can find a virtual subsitute of the traditional dice used by adventurers. You can roll any number of the standard dice and the roller will display the
                total score on the page.<br/>
                Finally, in the character sheets section you can find a record of your adventurers and create new characters.
